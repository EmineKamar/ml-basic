Review,Liked
Wow... Loved this place.,1
Crust is not good.,0
Not tasty and the texture was just nasty.,0
Stopped by during the late May bank holiday off Rick Steve recommendation and loved it.,1
The selection on the menu was great and so were the prices.,1
Now I am getting angry and I want my damn pho.,0
Honeslty it didn't taste THAT fresh.),0
The potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer.,0
The fries were great too.,1
A great touch.,1
Service was very prompt.,1
Would not go back.,0
The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced.,0
I tried the Cape Cod ravoli,0
I was disgusted because I was pretty sure that was human hair.,0
I was shocked because no signs indicate cash only.,1
Highly recommended.,0
Waitress was a little slow in service.,0
This place is not worth your time,0
did not like at all.,1
The Burrittos Blah!,1
The food,1
Service is also cute.,1
I could care less... The interior is just beautiful.,0
So they performed.,0
That's right....the red velvet cake.....ohhh this stuff is so good.,0
#NAME?,1
This hole in the wall has great Mexican street tacos,1
Took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was Luke warm,1
The worst was the salmon sashimi.,1
Also there are combos like a burger,0
This was like the final blow!,1
I found this place by accident and I could not be happier.,0
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food,0
Overall,1
The only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive.,0
Ample portions and good prices.,1
Poor service,1
My first visit to Hiro was a delight!,1
Service sucks.,1
The shrimp tender and moist.,1
There is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again.,0
Hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick.,0
On a positive note,0
Frozen pucks of disgust,1
The only thing I did like was the prime rib and dessert section.,1
It's too bad the food is so damn generic.,1
The burger is good beef,1
If you want a sandwich just go to any Firehouse!!!!!,1
My side Greek salad with the Greek dressing was so tasty,1
We ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside.,0
He came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table.,1
Their chow mein is so good!,1
They have horrible attitudes towards customers,0
The portion was huge!,0
Loved it...friendly servers,0
The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant.,1
Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom.,1
The salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop,0
The ripped banana was not only ripped,0
At least think to refill my water before I struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes.,0
This place receives stars for their APPETIZERS!!!,0
The cocktails are all handmade and delicious.,1
We'd definitely go back here again.,0
We are so glad we found this place.,1
Great food and service,0
Always a great time at Dos Gringos!,1
Update.....went back for a second time and it was still just as amazing,1
We got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy.,1
A great way to finish a great.,1
The deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks,0
#NAME?,0
The service was meh.,1
It took over 30 min to get their milkshake,1
I guess I should have known that this place would suck,0
The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well.,1
2 times - Very Bad Customer Service !,1
The sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well.,1
Today is the second time I've been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good.,1
There is so much good food in Vegas that I feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to Rice and Company.,1
Coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up.,1
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating.,1
The turkey and roast beef were bland.,1
This place has it!,0
The pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old.,0
I love the Pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try.,0
The poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying.,0
All I have to say is the food was amazing!!!,1
Omelets are to die for!,0
Everything was fresh and delicious!,0
In summary,0
It's like a really sexy party in your mouth,1
Never been to Hard Rock Casino before,0
Best breakfast buffet!!!,1
say bye bye to your tip lady!,1
We'll never go again.,1
Will be back again!,0
Food arrived quickly!,0
It was not good.,0
On the up side,0
Our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow,1
The only good thing was our waiter,1
Best Buffet in town,0
I LOVED their mussels cooked in this wine reduction,0
This is one of the better buffets that I have been to.,0
So we went to Tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon!,0
The food was delicious,1
The ambience is wonderful and there is music playing.,1
Will go back next trip out.,0
Sooooo good!!,0
REAL sushi lovers,1
At least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving,1
This is a really fantastic Thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit.,1
Nice,1
Good prices.,1
Check it out.,0
It was pretty gross!,1
I've had better atmosphere.,0
Kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did.,1
Although I very much liked the look and sound of this place,1
I just don't know how this place managed to served the blandest food I have ever eaten when they are preparing Indian cuisine.,1
Worst service to boot,0
Service was fine and the waitress was friendly.,0
The guys all had steaks,1
We thought you'd have to venture further away to get good sushi,1
Host staff were,1
Bland... Not a liking this place for a number of reasons and I don't want to waste time on bad reviewing.. I'll leave it at that...,0
Phenomenal food,0
I wouldn't return.,0
Definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly,0
This place is way too overpriced for mediocre food.,0
Penne vodka excellent!,1
They have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich,1
The management is rude.,1
Delicious NYC bagels,1
Great Subway,1
I had a seriously solid breakfast here.,0
This is one of the best bars with food in Vegas.,1
He was extremely rude and really,0
My drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions.,0
Don't do it!!!!,1
The waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us.,1
My husband and I ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service.,1
And the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very tasty to me.,0
Nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food.,1
The bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated.,1
The menu is always changing  food quality is going down & service is extremely slow.,1
The service was a little slow  considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace.,0
I give it 2 thumbs down,0
We watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us.,0
My fiancǸ and I came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away.,1
This is a great restaurant at the Mandalay Bay.,0
We waited for forty five minutes in vain.,1
Crostini that came with the salad was stale.,1
Some highlights : Great quality nigiri here!,0
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean.,1
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored.,0
I ordered the Voodoo pasta and it was the first time I'd had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago.,1
this place is good.,0
Unfortunately,0
I came back today since they relocated and still not impressed.,1
I was seated immediately.,1
Their menu is diverse,1
Avoid at all cost!,1
Restaurant is always full but never a wait.,1
DELICIOUS!!,1
This place is hands-down one of the best places to eat in the Phoenix metro area.,1
So don't go there if you are looking for good food...,0
I've never been treated so bad.,0
Bacon is hella salty.,1
We also ordered the spinach and avocado salad,0
This really is how Vegas fine dining used to be,0
The waitresses are very friendly.,1
Lordy,1
Everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter.,0
Perhaps I caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews,1
The service here leaves a lot to be desired.,0
The atmosphere is modern and hip,1
Not a weekly haunt,1
We literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order.,1
The burger had absolutely no flavor - the meat itself was totally bland,1
I also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack.,0
I dressed up to be treated so rudely!,1
It was probably dirt.,0
Love this place,1
I ordered the Lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible.,1
The food sucked,1
Interesting decor.,1
What I really like there is the crepe station.,1
Also were served hot bread and butter,1
you can watch them preparing the delicious food!),1
Both of the egg rolls were fantastic.,1
When my order arrived,1
I had a salad with the wings,1
I'm not really sure how Joey's was voted best hot dog in the Valley by readers of Phoenix Magazine.,0
The best place to go for a tasty bowl of Pho!,0
The live music on Fridays totally blows.,1
I've never been more insulted or felt disrespected.,0
Very friendly staff.,0
It is worth the drive.,1
I had heard good things about this place,1
Food was great and so was the serivce!,0
The warm beer didn't help.,0
Great brunch spot.,1
Service is friendly and inviting.,0
Very good lunch spot.,0
I've lived here since 1979 and this was the first (and last) time I've stepped foot into this place.,1
The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.,0
Must have been an off night at this place.,1
The sides are delish - mixed mushrooms,0
If that bug never showed up I would have given a 4 for sure,1
For about 10 minutes,1
My friend loved the salmon tartar.,0
Won't go back.,0
Extremely Tasty!,0
Waitress was good though!,1
Soggy and not good.,0
The Jamaican mojitos are delicious.,1
Which are small and not worth the price.,1
#NAME?,0
The shower area is outside so you can only rinse,1
The service was a bit lacking.,0
Lobster Bisque,0
Hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in.,1
It was either too cold,0
I loved the bacon wrapped dates.,1
This is an unbelievable BARGAIN!,1
The folks at Otto always make us feel so welcome and special.,1
"As for the ""mains,"" also uninspired.,0",1
This is the place where I first had pho and it was amazing!!,0
This wonderful experience made this place a must-stop whenever we are in town again.,0
If the food isn't bad enough for you,0
Very very fun chef.,1
Ordered a double cheeseburger & got a single patty that was falling apart (picture uploaded) Yeah,1
Great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with TV's.,0
If it were possible to give them zero stars,0
"The descriptions said ""yum yum sauce"" and another said ""eel sauce"", yet another said ""spicy mayo""...well NONE of the rolls had sauces on them.,0",0
I'd say that would be the hardest decision... Honestly,1
If she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed... Not sure if we will go back and try it again.,1
Everyone is very attentive,0
Horrible - don't waste your time and money.,1
Now this dish was quite flavourful.,1
By this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse.,0
(It wasn't busy either) Also,0
"like the other reviewer said ""you couldn't pay me to eat at this place again."",0",1
-Drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point.,0
Seriously flavorful delights,1
Much better than the other AYCE sushi place I went to in Vegas.,1
The lighting is just dark enough to set the mood.,1
Based on the sub-par service I received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business I won't be going back.,1
Owner's are really great people.!,0
There is nothing privileged about working/eating there.,1
The Greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful.,1
Overall,0
Now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty.,1
We had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast.,0
Fantastic service here.,1
I as well would've given godfathers zero stars if possible.,1
They know how to make them here.,0
very tough and very short on flavor!,0
I hope this place sticks around.,0
I have been in more than a few bars in Vegas,1
The restaurant atmosphere was exquisite.,0
Good service,0
The seafood was fresh and generous in portion.,0
Plus,1
The service was not up to par,1
Thus far,0
Just as good as when I had it more than a year ago!,0
For a self proclaimed coffee cafe,0
The Veggitarian platter is out of this world!,1
You cant go wrong with any of the food here.,0
You can't beat that.,0
Stopped by this place while in Madison for the Ironman,1
The chefs were friendly and did a good job.,1
I've had better,1
I liked the patio and the service was outstanding.,1
The goat taco didn't skimp on the meat and wow what FLAVOR!,0
I think not again,1
I had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so I will not be getting that again.,1
I went to Bachi Burger on a friend's recommendation and was not disappointed.,1
Service stinks here!,0
I waited and waited.,0
This place is not quality sushi,1
I would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza.,0
Great Pizza and Salads!,1
Things that went wrong: - They burned the saganaki.,1
We waited an hour for what was a breakfast I could have done 100 times better at home.,1
This place is amazing!,0
I hate to disagree with my fellow Yelpers,1
Waited 2 hours & never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did!,1
Just don't know why they were so slow.,0
The staff is great,0
I live in the neighborhood so I am disappointed I won't be back here,0
I didn't know pulled pork could be soooo delicious.,1
You get incredibly fresh fish,1
Before I go in to why I gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at Bachi burger before writing a review.,1
I love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it.,0
Never again will I be dining at this place!,0
The food was excellent and service was very good.,1
Good beer & drink selection and good food selection.,1
Please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles.,0
The potato chip order was sad... I could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12.,1
Food was really boring.,0
Good Service-check!,1
This greedy corporation will NEVER see another dime from me!,1
Will never,0
As much as I'd like to go back,1
In the summer,0
I did not expect this to be so good!,1
Fantastic food!,1
She ordered a toasted English muffin that came out untoasted.,1
The food was very good.,0
Never going back.,1
Great food for the price,0
The bus boy on the other hand was so rude.,1
By this point,0
Back to good BBQ,0
And considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about $20,1
All the bread is made in-house!,0
The only downside is the service.,1
Also,0
Service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews.,0
A couple of months later,0
Favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma!!!!!!,0
The black eyed peas and sweet potatoes... UNREAL!,1
You won't be disappointed.,1
They could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish,1
I go to far too many places and I've never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast,0
When my mom and I got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad.,1
The servers are not pleasant to deal with and they don't always honor Pizza Hut coupons.,1
Both of them were truly unbelievably good,0
We had fantastic service,1
Everything was gross.,1
I love this place.,0
Great service and food.,1
First - the bathrooms at this location were dirty- Seat covers were not replenished & just plain yucky!!!,0
"The burger... I got the ""Gold Standard"" a $17 burger and was kind of disappointed.,0",1
OMG,0
There is nothing authentic about this place.,1
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever.,1
Of all the dishes,1
The vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic Thai.,1
It's worth driving up from Tucson!,0
The selection was probably the worst I've seen in Vegas.....there was none.,0
Pretty good beer selection too.,0
This place is like Chipotle,1
Classy/warm atmosphere,1
5 stars for the brick oven bread app!,0
I have eaten here multiple times,1
We sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left.,1
He was terrible!,1
Everyone is treated equally special.,1
It shouldn't take 30 min for pancakes and eggs.,1
It was delicious!!!,0
On the good side,1
Sadly,1
As always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious!,1
Best fish I've ever had in my life!,1
(The bathroom is just next door and very nice.),1
The buffet is small and all the food they offered was BLAND.,1
This is an Outstanding little restaurant with some of the Best Food I have ever tasted.,0
Pretty cool I would say.,0
Definitely a turn off for me & i doubt I'll be back unless someone else is buying.,0
Server did a great job handling our large rowdy table.,0
I find wasting food to be despicable,0
My wife had the Lobster Bisque soup which was lukewarm.,1
Would come back again if I had a sushi craving while in Vegas.,1
The staff are great,1
He deserves 5 stars.,1
I left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day.,0
They dropped more than the ball.,1
The dining space is tiny,0
They will customize your order any way you'd like,1
And the beans and rice were mediocre at best.,0
Best tacos in town by far!!,1
I took back my money and got outta there.,1
In an interesting part of town,1
RUDE & INCONSIDERATE MANAGEMENT.,1
The staff are now not as friendly,0
I won't be back.,1
They have great dinners.,0
The service was outshining & I definitely recommend the Halibut.,0
The food was terrible.,1
WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK AND HAVE TOLD MANY PEOPLE WHAT HAD HAPPENED.,1
I don't recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving.,0
I will come back here every time I'm in Vegas.,1
This place deserves one star and 90% has to do with the food.,0
This is a disgrace.,1
Def coming back to bowl next time,1
If you want healthy authentic or ethic food,0
I will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night ... highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area.,1
I have been here several times in the past,1
We walked away stuffed and happy about our first Vegas buffet experience.,1
Service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is Vegas and located inside the Crystals shopping mall by Aria.,0
To summarize... the food was incredible,0
I'm probably one of the few people to ever go to Ians and not like it.,0
Kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos!,1
Service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see.,1
Cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable.,0
This one is simply a disappointment.,0
Overall,1
I don't have to be an accountant to know I'm getting screwed!,1
Great place to eat,1
Today was my first taste of a Buldogis Gourmet Hot Dog and I have to tell you it was more than I ever thought possible.,0
Left very frustrated.,1
I'll definitely be in soon again.,0
Food was really good and I got full petty fast.,0
Service was fantastic.,0
TOTAL WASTE OF TIME.,0
I don't know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea.,0
Come hungry,1
For service,0
I can assure you that you won't be disappointed.,1
I can take a little bad service but the food sucks.,1
Gave up trying to eat any of the crust (teeth still sore).,0
But now I was completely grossed out.,0
I really enjoyed eating here.,1
First time going but I think I will quickly become a regular.,0
Our server was very nice,1
From what my dinner companions told me...everything was very fresh with nice texture and taste.,0
On the ground,0
Furthermore,1
We've tried to like this place but after 10+ times I think we're done with them.,1
What a mistake that was!,1
No complaints!,0
This is some seriously good pizza and I'm an expert/connisseur on the topic.,1
Waiter was a jerk.,0
Strike 2,1
These are the nicest restaurant owners I've ever come across.,1
I never come again.,0
We loved the biscuits!!!,1
Service is quick and friendly.,1
Ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes.,1
So absolutley fantastic.,1
It was a huge awkward 1.5lb piece of cow that was 3/4ths gristle and fat.,1
definitely will come back here again.,0
I like Steiners because it's dark and it feels like a bar.,1
Wow very spicy but delicious.,0
If you're not familiar,0
I'll take my business dinner dollars elsewhere.,0
I'd love to go back.,1
Anyway,1
Nothing special.,0
Each day of the week they have a different deal and it's all so delicious!,1
Not to mention the combination of pears,0
Will not be back.,0
Sauce was tasteless.,0
The food is delicious and just spicy enough,1
My ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor.,1
I don't think we'll be going back anytime soon.,1
Food was so gooodd.,0
I am far from a sushi connoisseur but I can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food.,0
I was so insulted.,0
The last 3 times I had lunch here has been bad.,1
The chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat I have ever eaten.,1
The food was very good and I enjoyed every mouthful,1
Nargile - I think you are great.,0
Best tater tots in the southwest.,1
We loved the place.,0
Definitely not worth the $3 I paid.,1
The vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole (choux) pastry was fresh enough.,1
Im in AZ all the time and now have my new spot.,0
The manager was the worst.,0
The inside is really quite nice and very clean.,0
The food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable.,0
I don't think I'll be running back to Carly's anytime soon for food.,0
This is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged,0
Love the margaritas,1
This was my first and only Vegas buffet and it did not disappoint.,0
Very good,0
The one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading.,1
Great pork sandwich.,1
Don't waste your time here.,1
Total letdown,0
Third,1
We enjoy their pizza and brunch.,1
The steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked.,1
We had a group of 70+ when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully.,1
I LOVED it!,1
We asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didn't bring that either.,1
This place is a jewel in Las Vegas,1
Seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh.,1
The selection of food was not the best.,1
Delicious and I will absolutely be back!,0
This isn't a small family restaurant,0
They had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and I liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle.,1
I dont think I will be back for a very long time.,0
It was attached to a gas station,1
How awesome is that.,1
I will be back many times soon.,1
The menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide!,1
Worse of all,0
CONCLUSION: Very filling meals.,1
Their daily specials are always a hit with my group.,0
And then tragedy struck.,0
The pancake was also really good and pretty large at that.,1
This was my first crawfish experience,1
Their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite.,0
Waitress was sweet and funny.,1
I also had to taste my Mom's multi-grain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing,1
I'd rather eat airline food,1
Cant say enough good things about this place.,1
The ambiance was incredible.,0
The waitress and manager are so friendly.,0
I would not recommend this place.,0
Overall I wasn't very impressed with Noca.,1
My gyro was basically lettuce only.,1
Terrible service!,1
Thoroughly disappointed!,0
I don't each much pasta,1
Give it a try,0
By far the BEST cheesecurds we have ever had!,0
Reasonably priced also!,1
Everything was perfect the night we were in.,0
The food is very good for your typical bar food.,1
it was a drive to get there.,1
At first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe - nice ambiance,0
Anyway,0
Point your finger at any item on the menu,1
Oh this is such a thing of beauty,1
If you haven't gone here GO NOW!,1
A greasy,1
first time there and might just be the last.,0
Those burgers were amazing.,1
Similarly,0
And it was way to expensive.,1
Be sure to order dessert,1
This was my first time and I can't wait until the next.,1
The bartender was also nice.,1
Everything was good and tasty!,1
This place is two thumbs up....way up.,0
The best place in Vegas for breakfast (just check out a Sat,0
If you love authentic Mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting,0
Terrible management.,1
An excellent new restaurant by an experienced Frenchman.,1
If there were zero stars I would give it zero stars.,1
Great steak,1
Worst martini ever!,0
The steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at GC.,1
I had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas!,1
We waited for thirty minutes to be seated (although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting).,0
The yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh.,0
I won't try going back there even if it's empty.,0
No,0
Just spicy enough.. Perfect actually.,1
Last night was my second time dining here and I was so happy I decided to go back!,1
"not even a ""hello, we will be right with you."",0",1
The desserts were a bit strange.,0
My boyfriend and I came here for the first time on a recent trip to Vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service.,1
I really do recommend this place,1
Nice ambiance.,0
I would recommend saving room for this!,1
I guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful.,0
However,0
I know this is not like the other restaurants at all,1
AVOID THIS ESTABLISHMENT!,1
I think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough.,0
All of the tapas dishes were delicious!,1
I *heart* this place.,0
My salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of Palm.,1
After two I felt disgusting.,0
A good time!,0
I believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi.,1
Generous portions and great taste.,1
I will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone!,1
"The servers went back and forth several times, not even so much as an ""Are you being helped?"",0",0
Food was delicious!,1
AN HOUR... seriously?,0
I consider this theft.,1
Eew... This location needs a complete overhaul.,0
